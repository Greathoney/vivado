LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell count_lcdclk[10]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) count_lcdclk_reg[0]/CLR, count_lcdclk_reg[10]/CLR, count_lcdclk_reg[1]/CLR, count_lcdclk_reg[2]/CLR, count_lcdclk_reg[3]/CLR, count_lcdclk_reg[4]/CLR, count_lcdclk_reg[5]/CLR, count_lcdclk_reg[6]/CLR, count_lcdclk_reg[7]/CLR, count_lcdclk_reg[8]/CLR, count_lcdclk_reg[9]/CLR, count_mode_reg[0]/CLR, count_mode_reg[1]/CLR, count_mode_reg[2]/CLR, count_mode_reg[3]/CLR (the first 15 of 22 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
